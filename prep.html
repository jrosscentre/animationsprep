<h1>How Dr. B did those Animaitons</h1>
<div>
<p>
The really cool animations Doctor Bradshaw did with the test scores came from a JavaFX file. This file contains different things that can be used when making a java chart. Some of these things include actual chart models and also animations.The API lets the user choose from a library of animations to perform on the data.
